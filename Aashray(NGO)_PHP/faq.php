                    We ensure that contribution made by people is used in the best possible manner. We use people’s donations in providing stationery, mid-day meals and books to children. We also use these donations in extending our support to more children by increasing the number of enrollments. Aashray runs various programs to work with children in difficult circumstances. These programs essentially focus on education, health care, nutrition and shelter. We also enroll children in child media programs and ensure their participation in the innovative programs to empower them so that they can voice their opinions.
